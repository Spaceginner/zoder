An experimental lossless image compression algorithm. Inspired by nonograms.

## Status

Currently, while it can compress its decompressor is pretty bad, and unless you are International Grand Master in solving nonograms, it is useless. So, this project's goal (accidently) is to make perfect algorithm for solving nonograms

## Plans

In future, I would like to implement some converter between ordinary file and an image, so it was possible to compress even files. Also would like to store compressed data in a more optimised way than JSON file.
